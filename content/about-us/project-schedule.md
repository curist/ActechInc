## Project Schedule

One day in 1996, John of Inventory Science Systems who was the owner of an inventory auditing service, decided that he could make a new handheld data collector that would be better than any other available. 

John then approached someone to design the housing and its related parts. Two months later, armed with the drawings of the housing of his new Baby, John excitedly surfed the Internet and sent approximately 100 inquiries worldwide to find someone to make the housing for him. 

A few companies got back to John. Others didn't even bother to reply. Of those who replied, some echoed BIG BUCKS while others were too vague in their answers, and some of the injection molders said that it would take up to one year to get the mold made. 

And then from the across the net, came a solid reply. It was from a company called Actech. Actech answered John's call for help, asked the right questions and determined within 24 hours what John's needs were. 

Upon receipt of all relevant information, Actech provided John with a complete quotation within 48 hours - quick, hassle-free service without the red tape associated with a BIG Company. 

Mock-Up sample; Metal Mold / Tooling Cost; Molding / Unit Cost; Secondary Operations Cost. 

Finally, John & his wife, Lisa, decided to invite Actech to participate in the delivery of their First new BABY.
